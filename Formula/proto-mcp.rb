# proto-mcp Homebrew cask formula.
#
# Phase 7/E. Lives in the main repo for now; will migrate to a
# dedicated tap (`homebrew-proto-mcp`) once the first signed
# release is published. The url + sha256 are populated by the
# release pipeline on tag push; the placeholders below are the
# contract.
#
# Install:
#   brew tap lnadalsec/proto-mcp
#   brew install --cask proto-mcp
#
# Cask token is `proto-mcp` (with hyphen) deliberately — keeps
# our branding clearly distinct from Proton AG's products and
# avoids implying an official "Proton MCP" relationship. The
# binaries inside the tarball stay named `protonmcp`,
# `protonmcpd`, etc. (changing those would invalidate every
# existing user's keychain service ID + LaunchAgent label).

  version "0.0.0"  # release.sh replaces on tag (e.g. "1.0.0")
  sha256 :no_check # release.sh replaces with the artifact sha256

  depends_on macos: :ventura  # ">= Ventura"; bare symbol is Homebrew's required form (the ">= :ventura" string is deprecated)
  # No arch constraint: the tarball ships universal (arm64 + x86_64)
  # binaries, built by `make universal` and verified by release.sh.

  # The tarball lays everything in a single flat dir
  # (proto-mcp-<version>/). All five binaries land in
  # HOMEBREW_PREFIX/bin which matches the path-resolution code in
  # internal/approval/path.go and internal/serve/lockwatch.go
  # (same-dir-as-running-binary lookup).

  binary "proto-mcp-#{version}/protonmcp-lockwatch"

  # No app bundle, no LaunchDaemon plist baked in — the
  # `protonmcp daemon install` subcommand wires the LaunchAgent
  # plist into ~/Library/LaunchAgents at first run.
  #
  # Because that plist is written at runtime rather than by the cask,
  # Homebrew doesn't know about it and won't unload it. Without the
  # `uninstall launchctl:` below, `brew uninstall --cask proto-mcp`
  # deleted the binaries but left the LaunchAgent bootstrapped and
  # pointing at a now-dangling symlink, so launchd kept trying to
  # spawn a binary that no longer existed. Naming the label here makes
  # Homebrew bootout the agent before removing anything.
  #
  # `delete` (not `trash`) for the plist: it's a generated file with no
  # user content, and leaving it in ~/.Trash means a later `brew
  # install` finds a stale plist if the user ever restores it.
  uninstall launchctl: "zone.dort.protonmcpd",
            delete:    "~/Library/LaunchAgents/zone.dort.protonmcpd.plist"

  # zap additionally removes user data the plain uninstall preserves:
  # the local mail mirror, the recorded binary hash, and the logs. The
  # Keychain session is NOT zapped — `protonmcp logout` revokes it
  # server-side, which a file delete cannot do.
  zap trash: [

  caveats <<~CAVEATS
    To complete setup, run:

      protonmcp setup

    It signs you in, copies your mailbox index, starts the background
    service, and connects Claude Desktop + Claude Code. Safe to re-run —
    completed steps are skipped.

    Restart Claude Desktop / Claude Code afterward. To re-check the
    install at any time:

      protonmcp doctor

    Upgrading: the daemon keeps running the previous build until it is
    restarted, so after `brew upgrade --cask proto-mcp` run:

      protonmcp daemon restart

    See https://github.com/lnadalsec/proto-mcp for full docs.
