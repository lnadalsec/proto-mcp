# Local release pipeline for proto-mcp.
#
# Runs the full sign → notarize → package → upload flow from your
# own machine. No secrets in cloud. Invoked by `make release
# VERSION=v1.0.0`.
#
# Requires:
#   - DEVELOPER_ID env var set to the signing identity string
#   - notarytool keychain profile "protonmcp-notary" already
#     configured (see scripts/signing-setup.md)
#   - `gh` CLI authenticated (run `gh auth status` to verify)
#   - clean working tree (uncommitted changes? probably want to
#     commit them before tagging)
#
# Usage:
#   export DEVELOPER_ID='Developer ID Application: <NAME> (<TEAMID>)'
#   make release VERSION=v1.0.0
#
# Or directly:
#   ./scripts/release.sh v1.0.0
