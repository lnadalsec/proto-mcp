//     check would be bypassable by an attacker who could set one
//     env var (`PROTONMCP_TOUCHID=/bin/true` → all Touch ID
//     prompts auto-approve, with audit showing
//     approval_source=touchid for what is in fact no auth).
//  2. Sibling of argv[0]: helpers/touchid/protonmcp-touchid relative
//     to filepath.Dir(argv[0]).
//  3. /Applications/protonmcp.app/Contents/MacOS/protonmcp-touchid
//     (Phase 7 packaged app).
//
// Returns the first existing executable path. If none exist, returns
// an error listing all the locations tried so the user knows where
// to put the binary.
