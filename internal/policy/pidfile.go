//
// PROTO-152: protonmcpd was previously undiscoverable, so all three
// commands reported "not running" against a perfectly healthy daemon
// — which left a screen-locked daemon with no route back short of a
// restart, and made `policy reload` silently no-op while printing
// success. Two independent bugs caused it, either fatal alone:
//
//  1. Discovery was a lone `pgrep -f "protonmcp serve-stdio"`. The
//     daemon's argv is just its binary path, with no subcommand to
//     match, so pgrep never returned it.
//  2. Survivors were filtered by os.SameFile against the *calling*
//     binary. The CLI that signals is a different file from the
//     daemon it signals, so that test excluded protonmcpd by
//     construction even when pgrep did find it.
//
// Three sources are now unioned, each with its own identity check.
//
// Excludes os.Getpid() so a `policy reload` invoked from inside an
// MCP-tool handler doesn't signal itself (which would race with the
// engine.Reload SIGHUP handler).
//
// SECURITY D33 / D34: pgrep -f matches the full command line, so it
// also picks up wrappers (Claude.app/Contents/Helpers/disclaimer
// invokes protonmcp with serve-stdio in argv) and editor processes
// holding a file of that name open. Every candidate is still post-
// filtered against its real executable via proc_pidpath, and PIDs
// whose path can't be resolved are dropped — better to miss one than
// to signal a stranger, which for SIGUSR1/2 means killing it.
