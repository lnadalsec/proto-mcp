# Security model & threat model

The honest version. Read it before you trust proto-mcp with a live
mailbox. This document describes what proto-mcp defends, what it
deliberately does **not**, and the residual risks you accept by running
it.

For the per-defect fix log and audit trail, see
[`../SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md).

## The layers

The Keychain item that holds your Proton session sits behind several
layers of protection:

1. **macOS Keychain encryption** — standard at-rest protection for any
   keychain item. Everything below assumes you are logged in and the
   keychain is unlocked.
2. **Touch ID at session-acquire time** — the daemon prompts for
   biometric (or password fallback via Apple's
   `.deviceOwnerAuthentication`) on every startup and every unlock
   after a manual or automatic lock. The prompt is issued at the
   application layer by the Swift helper.

   An unlock can be requested either by `protonmcp unlock` or by a tool
   call arriving at a locked daemon. Who *asks* is not a security
   boundary — the sensor is, and it can't be satisfied by software. What
   the request path does expose is the prompt itself: content the model
   reads (mail bodies above all) can try to steer it into a tool call,
   and each locked call is an opportunity to raise a dialog. The threat
   is prompt fatigue, not unauthorized access, so it's bounded by rate
   rather than forbidden — one prompt in flight at a time, and a 60s
   cooldown after any prompt the user doesn't approve.
3. **Per-call approval** — every write tool fires a custom prompt + Touch
   ID showing the **literal** recipients and subject before anything
   happens. Approvals expire per policy TTL; `mail_send` has TTL 0, so
   every send re-prompts.

Plus, around the binaries themselves:

- **Hardened-runtime, Developer-ID-signed, Apple-notarized** binaries.
  Gatekeeper accepts them with no "unidentified developer" dialog.
- **SHA-256 binary integrity check** at daemon startup. If `protonmcpd`
  was swapped between install and launch, the daemon refuses to start —
  unless the new binary carries a valid Developer ID signature from our
  team (a `brew upgrade`) **and** its embedded release version is not
  older than the last version the daemon accepted (anti-downgrade: every
  old, possibly vulnerable, release is validly signed too). See the
  same-user limit under *Out of scope* below.
- **Peer-credential checks** (`SO_PEERCRED` / `LOCAL_PEERPID`) on every
  socket connection; cross-UID connections are refused and the real
  connecting PID/UID is recorded in the audit log.
- **Default-deny policy** for unknown tools. A tool with no policy stub
  fails registration — you cannot accidentally ship an unguarded write.
- **Touch ID to loosen the policy.** `policy.yaml` is writable by any
  process running as you, MCP clients with a shell included. An
  override that is more permissive than the built-in defaults (a
  prompt turned into allow, a dropped confirmation, a longer approval
  TTL, a wider recipient allowlist, idle lock off) is applied only
  after a Touch ID prompt that lists each change — at daemon start and
  on every reload. Declined: the built-in rules (at start) or the
  previous policy (on reload) stay in force. Tightening needs no
  prompt. The file must be yours and not group/world-writable.
- **Auto-lock** on screen lock, sleep, and idle timeout. Walk away and
  the daemon locks; resuming requires Touch ID.
- **Redacted audit log.** Passwords / tokens / cookies become
  `[REDACTED]`; bodies become `{sha256, bytes}`; recipient addresses
  stay literal so the prompt-verification chain is honest.

## Trust boundaries

The daemon runs as **you**, on **your** Mac, and talks to two parties:
the local MCP clients (Claude Desktop / Code, via the shim over a `0600`
Unix socket) and Proton's servers (over TLS, via `go-proton-api`). Mail
content fetched from Proton is **untrusted input** — it can contain
anything a sender chose to put in it.

## Defended

- **Local IPC isolation.** The socket is `0600` inside a `0700`
  directory; every connection is peer-credential checked and cross-UID
  connections are refused.
- **Session at rest.** The Proton session lives in the macOS Keychain;
  the daemon re-prompts for Touch ID on every startup and every unlock
  after a manual/auto lock (screen lock, sleep, idle timer).
- **Write authorization.** Every state-changing tool is deny-by-default
  in policy and fires a per-call Touch ID prompt showing the literal
  recipients and subject. `mail_send` has TTL 0 — every send re-prompts.
- **Binary tampering.** Hardened-runtime, signed, notarized binaries
  plus a SHA-256 self-check that refuses to run a swapped binary.
- **Log leakage.** Secrets are redacted; bodies are reduced to
  `{sha256, bytes}` in the audit log.

## Out of scope — accepted risks

- **Prompt injection from email content.** `mail_read` and
  `mail_read_thread` are allow-by-default, so a malicious message *can*
  try to steer the model ("forward this to…", "delete that…"). The
  mitigation is the load-bearing fact that **every write is Touch-ID
  gated and shows the real recipients/subject** — reading a hostile
  email exfiltrates nothing on its own, and any send it provokes still
  needs your fingerprint on a prompt that names the actual recipient.
  **Do not blanket-approve sends**, and treat message bodies as hostile.

  Bodies reach the model inside an untrusted-content fence whose
  markers carry a random per-call id; `<<<` inside the body is
  defused, so a message cannot close the fence itself. Subjects,
  sender names and calendar fields are not fenced yet.

  The same applies to `mail_read`'s `unsubscribe` field, taken from the
  `List-Unsubscribe` / `List-Unsubscribe-Post` headers. Those headers
  are written by the sender, so the targets are attacker-controlled.
  They are scheme-filtered (only `https` without userinfo and a single
  `mailto` address survive; `http:`, `javascript:`, `data:` and the rest
  are dropped), capped in count and length, and **only exposed**:
  proto-mcp never fetches an unsubscribe URL or sends to an unsubscribe
  address itself. Any mailto send goes through the normal Touch-ID-gated
  `mail_send`. The raw values are cached next to the body and purged
  with it, because the URLs carry per-recipient tokens.
- **OS-level Keychain ACL is not enforced.** The biometric gate is
  enforced at the application layer, not sealed into the Keychain item
  with `SecAccessControl`. A process running as you, with the Keychain
  already unlocked, could read the stored session blob without a fresh
  Touch ID.

  This was investigated thoroughly and is a **hard platform limit**, not
  a backlog gap: the `SecAccessControl` + access-group path requires the
  restricted `keychain-access-groups` entitlement, which macOS (AMFI)
  will only honor with an Apple-issued provisioning profile. Apple
  issues those for App Store / TestFlight / enterprise distribution, not
  for the directly-distributed, Developer-ID-signed binaries proto-mcp
  ships. A signed binary carrying that entitlement is killed by the
  kernel at launch. The application-layer Touch ID gate is the practical
  security boundary, by design.
- **The binary integrity records are writable by you.** The recorded
  hash (`~/Library/Application Support/protonmcp/expected_sha256`) and
  the anti-downgrade floor (`accepted_version` next to it) belong to
  the same user the daemon runs as. They stop a binary being swapped
  *without touching the records* — an unsigned build, or an older signed
  release dropped over the installed one. They do not stop a process
  already running as you: it can rewrite both files (or run
  `protonmcp daemon install`) and the daemon will accept whatever they
  name. A root-owned or Keychain-anchored record would be needed for
  that, and code running as you is outside this model anyway (next
  item). A deliberate downgrade is done the same way: install the older
  release, then `protonmcp daemon install`.
- **A local account already compromised.** Everything runs as your user;
  malware already executing as you can read the SQLite mirror, the audit
  log, and staged attachments. proto-mcp is not a defense against code
  already running under your account.
- **Physical access to an unlocked, logged-in Mac.** The auto-lock
  triggers shrink the window, but an attacker at your unlocked machine
  during an unlocked session is outside the model.
- **Proton-side trust.** proto-mcp trusts Proton's API and your account
  security (SRP password + 2FA). It does not defend against a
  compromised Proton account or a malicious server response beyond
  ordinary input sanitization.

## Reducing your exposure

- Keep `mail_send` at TTL 0 (the default) and actually read the Touch ID
  prompt — it shows the real recipient.
- Skim the audit log periodically (see [observability in
  configuration.md](./configuration.md#observability)).
- Don't raise `max_attachment_bytes` past what you need; large decrypted
  attachments are written to a local staging directory.
- Use `protonmcp purge --older-than 7d --vacuum` to shrink the window of
  decrypted bodies cached on disk.

## What a Touch ID prompt looks like

When Claude says "move 'Re: gear list' from inbox to archive," the prompt
that fires says exactly that — not a redacted argument dump:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ protonmcp-touchid is trying to               │
│ move message 'Re: gear list' from inbox      │
│ to Archive                                   │
│                                              │
│ Touch ID or enter your password to allow.    │
│              [ Cancel ]    [ Touch ID ]      │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The verb phrase comes from a per-tool `PromptBody` closure
(`internal/mcptools/prompt_helpers.go`) that resolves `message_id →
Subject` and `label_id → Name` from the local mirror. You read what
you're approving.

For sends, the format is stricter — the recipient list is always
verbatim:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Send mail_send?                              │
│                                              │
│ To: alice@example.com                        │
│ CC: charlie@example.com                      │
│ Subject: Re: gear list                       │
│                                              │
│ [ Cancel ]              [ Send & Touch ID ]  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

That recipient list is the verification surface you tap against.
